            <p><span>By: Jackie Zamora and Ray DePaul</span></p>

            <p>The Civics Examination in the United States dates back to the early 19th century. It has undergone several dynamic changes, but the most important being a gravitation towards questions related to constitutional principles in the 20th century, as opposed to general facts about the country.</p>
